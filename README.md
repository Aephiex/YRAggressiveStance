# FAQ

Q: How to use it?

A: Follow the steps.
1. Either download the source code and build a DLL, or download the built DLL from the release panel.
2. Put the DLL into the same location as `Syringe.exe` and `Ares.dll`. It is supposed to be detected by `Syringe.exe` and allows the use of Aggressive Stance.
3. After the game is launched, you are supposed to see Aggressive Stance in the hotkey configuration menu.
4. Select your armed units and/or buildings and press the configured hotkey. They will now passively engage unarmed enemy buildings.


Q: Is it safe to use it in multiplayer games?

A: This is multiplayer safe as long as every human player has `YRAggressiveStance.dll` installed. If **any** human player did not install `YRAggressiveStance.dll`, any attempt to make use of the Aggressive Stance will lead to a desync. **This extension CANNOT be used as a cheat.**


Q: Do you take feature requests?

A: Sorry, I don't.


Q: Can I make a modified build of `YRAggressiveStance.dll`?

A: Of course. Just make sure every human player has the identical `YRAggressiveStance.dll` installed, or the game will end in a desync. I am not responsible if someone tries to cheat in a multiplayer game using a modified build of `YRAggressiveStance.dll`, the same trick can be used on any open-source extension, even `Phobos.dll`.
